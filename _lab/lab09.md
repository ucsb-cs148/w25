# Final Code Release and Deployment

Look back on [Lab04 MVP Tag/Release instructions](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/lab/lab04/) to remind yourselves on how to do a tag and release and do a "Project Demo" Tag and numbered Release for your Code Freeze by **Fri, 03/14, 23:59:59**.

By the same deadline, add a `#Deployment` section at the bottom of your README.md, which points to a live testable version of your project, either on your deployment platform of choice, or to platform binaries (e.g. hosted on Google Drive). 

If it is not possible for you to create a distributable binary of your product for some reason (e.g. IOS ipa) or if you're using ExpoGO, please document the exact installation/run procedure or assist the teaching team members individually in getting your app deployed to their devices (ideally during Friday's lab session).

The deadline for your Manual and for the Design Document remains the coming **Tue 03/18, 23:59:59**, one day after the live project demonstration.

# Team Roles and Github Contributions

As started during the last lab, we ask every team to comment on the code contributions that every team member made. Finalize documenting the roles the team members played in the code development effort. You can comment on team contributions otther than coding as well. In your github team folder, you created a `contributions` subfolder during the last lab. 

By **Tue, 03/18 23:59:59**: finalize commentary on team member code and/or other contributions in `team/contributions/CONTRIBS.md`: 
*each team member* should make sure their own section is fully updated:     
  - Each team member document their contributions in `team/contributions/contrib_Alice.md`, `team/contributions/contrib_Bob.md`, `team/contributions/contrib_Carol.md`, `team/contributions/contrib_Danny.md`...
  - Then: the person assembling the overall report summarizes all the individual contributions in a team-wide CONTRIBS.md


# All Team members: Fill out third and final CATME.org peer eval survey (by **Tue, 03/18, 11:59pm**)

You earn 25 individual points for submitting feedback on your team mates' and overall team performance via a third and last CATME.org form survey that you got email invitations for. 


# Lessons Learned 

Every student will post at least one **"What I wish I had known when I started this class"** lesson learned in our #wish-i-had-known Slack channel. 
Examples: 
* During a rebase, *just rebase*.  Don't make changes (i.e. fix bugs, add features) during a rebase. Only focus on fixing merge conflicts. Make your changes to fix bugs or add features before the rebase, or after the rebase, but *not during*.
* Making sure to listen to your team mates and give everyone a chance to feel like they are a part of the team, because the internal team work and how everyone contributes is crucial to the team's effectiveness and success. 
* The `git bisect` tool [can help you figure out](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) with what commit you introduced a crucial change in your repository. 


# Participation in Audience Choice Award

On **Mon, 03/17, 4pm-7pm**, you will follow all project demonstrations and interactive Q&A during our final slot project presentation session and submit the Google Form after that.  In order to receive these individual 10 lab points, your vote needs to be submitted by the end of that day.
