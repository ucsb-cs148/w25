# Announcements
* Lab05: Over the following week you will practice Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, considering your MVP peer evaluation feedback, work on continued functionality development, practice some unit testing towards test-based design, and experiment with AI-supported development! 
* Don't forget Sprint Review and Sprint Planning Meetings 

* Next week (Lab06), we'll hold the Second Retrospective (the MVP release is a great opportunity to review the next steps)


# Points for Lab05

<div class="grade" markdown="1">

**Graded**: ({{page.num}}-T) (35 pts) Review, assess, and summarize the feedback you received on your MVP evaluation and formulate an action plan going forward. See below.

**Graded**: ({{page.num}}-T) (35 pts) You earn these team points for identifying at least one testing library to experiment with for your coding needs, and for implementing and documenting at least one unit test in your code base by next week, {{page.due}} (see instructions below).

**Graded**: ({{page.num}}-I) (30 pts) You earn these individual points by doing and documenting at least one "Coding with AI" experiment over the coming week. This can take multiple forms: Using AI to prototype UI possibilities (e.g. using ChatGPT or v0.dev for React-based web pages), help with writing testing code (see previous bullet, e.g. using Github Copilot or Codeium), generating documentation (e.g. using Github Copilot, Codeium, or similar plugins), researching scalability suggestions for your app, etc. More details below.

* **(35 pts) Review, assess, and summarize the feedback you received on your MVP evaluation and formulate an action plan going forward.**
    * Feedback has been posted in your project Slack channel. Please review and organize (group). Then discuss action items and user stories in response and prioritize them.  
    * Please create a `team/MVP_FOLLOWUP.md` file, where you document this process (e.g., with subheadings such as):  
        * Feedback Grouped and Sorted 
        * Response Actions 
        * Next Steps    

* **(35 pts) You earn these team points for identifying at least one testing library to experiment with for your coding needs, and for implementing and documenting at least one unit test in your code base by Friday, EOD.**
    * Please create a `team/TESTING.md` file, where you document the testing library/ies and approach/es you experiemnted with and the unit test(s) that you implemented in your codebase. 

* **(30 pts) You earn these individual points by doing and documenting at least one "Coding with AI" experiment by Friday, EOD.**
    * This can take multiple forms: Using AI to prototype UI possibilities or even entire apps (e.g. using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Deep Seek](https://www.deepseek.com/), or [Vercel v0.dev](http://v0.dev/) for React-based web pages), help with writing testing code (e.g. using [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or [Codeium](https://codeium.com), generating documentation (e.g. using [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Codeium](https://codeium.com), or similar plugins, or using an AI-first IDE such as [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Replit Ghostwriter](https://replit.com/learn/intro-to-ghostwriter)), designing UI art/elements using [Dall-e](https://openai.com/dall-e-3), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), or [Adobe Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/), researching scalability suggestions for your app, etc.
    * Please create a `team/AI_CODING.md` file, where each of the team members documents their individual AI coding experiments. List the AI tool you utilized, the outcomes you produced, **and, importantly, reflections on** 
        * how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
        * what steps you needed to (or couldn't) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use  

    * A new Slack channel `help_ai` was created to provide pointers to useful AI coding tools. In addition to documenting your efforts in your own team-internal `team/AI_CODING.md` file, please share pointers to the tools you were most excited about in there.
