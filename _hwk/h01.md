Read the material at the following web page. It's relatively short.

Also read these four pages to which it links.  Each of them is also relatively short.

* [Advantages of the “As a user, I want” user story template](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template)
* [A Sample Format for a Spreadsheet-Based Product Backlog](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/a-sample-format-for-a-spreadsheet-based-product-backlog)
* [Advantages of User Stories for Requirements](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/articles/advantages-of-user-stories-for-requirements)
* [Non-functional Requirements as User Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/non-functional-requirements-as-user-stories)

You are also strongly encouraged (though not required for this homework assignment) to watch this video:
* [Introduction to User Stories (52 minute video)](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/presentations/introduction-to-user-stories).   You will be required to watch it for a later assignment, so you might as well watch it now if you have the time.

Then answer some questions for this assignment on Gradescope.
