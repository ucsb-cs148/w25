For this homework, please read these articles.   Don't be alarmed that there are three of them; each is short.

* [Michael Lynch on Test Code](https://mtlynch.io/good-developers-bad-tests/) 
* [Kent C Dodds on the Testing Trophy](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/unit-vs-integration-vs-e2e-tests)
* [Naidele Manjunath and Olivier de Meulder on BDD at the New York Times](https://open.nytimes.com/no-code-no-problem-writing-tests-in-plain-english-537827eaaa6e)
([Here](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/NoCode_NoProblem%E2%80%94WritingTestsInPlainEnglish.pdf) is a PDF of that last article, just in case you don't have any free articles on Medium)
* [No-Code App Development](https://zenkit.com/en/blog/what-is-no-code-a-guide/) might be on the upswing (especially with increasingly competent AI help).

Then answer the questions at this Gradescope Assignment:
