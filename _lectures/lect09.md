# Announcements
* H08 due at **End of Day** next Monday (Presidents' Day holiday)
* Lab05 updates as follows: 

# Lab05 Updates: 
* **(35 pts) Review, assess, and summarize the feedback you received on your MVP evaluation and formulate an action plan going forward.**
* **(35 pts) You earn these team points for identifying at least one testing library to experiment with for your coding needs, and for implementing and documenting at least one unit test in your code base by Friday, EOD.**
    * Please create a `team/TESTING.md` file, where you document the testing library/ies and approach/es you experiemnted with and the unit test(s) that you implemented in your codebase. 
* **(30 pts) You earn these individual points by doing and documenting at least one "Coding with AI" experiment by Friday, EOD.**
    * Please create a `team/AI_CODING.md` file, where each of the team members documents their individual AI coding experiments. List the AI tool you utilized, the outcomes you produced, **and, importantly, reflections on** 
        * how useful this tool was / potentially could be for your coding effort going forward
        * what steps you needed to (or couldn't) take to ensure that the AI output was correct, understandable, and fair use  

* A new Slack channel `help_ai` was created to provide pointers to useful AI coding tools. In addition to documenting your efforts in your own team-internal `team/AI_CODING.md` file, please share pointers to the tools you were most excited about in there.

* A new Slack channel `help_swtesting` was created to provide pointers to useful software testing tools and libraries. In addition to documenting your efforts in your own team-internal `team/TESTING.md` file, please share pointers to the tools you were most excited about in there.  

# Work in Breakout Groups
* Standup
* Organize and review MVP feedback, prepare action plan going forward 
* Discuss AI experiment strategy
* Discuss SW Testing strategy
