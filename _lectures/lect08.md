* Everyone will **take notes and submit a quick peer-feedback form** on each other presentation in your section while watching the presentations during class. 
    * Please fill in the review form announced on Slack during your session during the video presentations. Submission of this form will count towards your lab04 points. If you cannot attend today's lecture, you can watch the [prepared videos](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16dpihuLjsv3rjEDqbXLjG7wxP24qtgpuWBBsVncedO8/edit?usp=sharing) and fill the form in before the end of the current lab. 

<br />   
*After each video presentation, a representative from *the group listed above as being teamed with you* will **ask a question** to the team whose video was just shown. That question should be typed in a special Slack Channel @mvp-presentation (so that we capture it) and read out by the representative for the team asking the question. 
    * The question can be of any type, e.g. a follow-up on something that was not entirely clear, a low-level implementation question, a question about possible future functionality, or a high-level question about the product landscape connected to the project. 

<br />
* After the peer team asked their question, there will be an opportunity for **anyone to ask a question** to the team whose video was shown, but if there are many questions, we may have to cut it short. We ask that any questions that are asked be captured in the Slack channel! We also may chime in with questions and comments from the teaching team. 

* After all project videos have been shown, everyone will be asked to **vote for their favorite MVPs**. You will receive the link to that review form in the Slack channel.  We will announce the audience choice award winner for best MVP in your Section next week, as well as on Slack (which gives you bragging rights, but no influence on your grades. Grades will solely be based on final product presentations and quality).  

# Celebrate

We want to **celebrate** with you on how far you have already come - We are really proud and excited about every single team's progress since the start of the quarter. It's a journey, and we should enjoy it! 


# Continuous Integration / Continouous Delivery (CI/CD) 

* **Continuous Delivery**: Software development process that aims to build software that is *always* ready to be deployed into production
* **Continuous Integration**: Technique where every developer on a project should integrate their work daily with every other developer
* [Video: Continuous Delivery Assembly Line Metaphor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIaVsG7m8n4)


* Reminder: This week, Github Projects Kanban board should reflect all your activity leading up to the MVP 
* Clear **Acceptance Criteria** on all your completed issues!
