# Announcements
* **Second CATME peer eval**: You earn 20 individual points towards lab06 for submitting feedback on overall team performance via a second CATME.org form survey that you got email invitations for today. Deadline for submittting is **Friday 02/21/25, 11:59pm PDT**.
* [Homework assignment h08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/hwk/h08/) on SW Design Patterns / Code Smells posted. Due **Monday in a week**. 

* **Inter-Team Evaluation** next Wednesday!  
    * Get your project to a point where all members from another team can get your project deployed and tested.
    * For this week's lab you are enumerating evaluation needs. For next Wednesday, you/we will pick one of these for the other team to give you feedback! 

* **Focus on your projects**. Lab work in the coming weeks will focus on documentation (**design document**, **user manual**) in order to get your documents started and to utilize cycles of team members not central to ongoing implementation efforts at any given time. 
** Project documentation will happen in three major documents: 
    * **design document** (to be started in lab07),
    * **user manual** (to be started in lab08))
    * **deployment instructions** (started already for MVP, crucial for deployment/UX peer review in week 9 (Mon., 03/04) and Github **README.md**, which should explain the code folder hierarchy and guide through the implementation effort. 
* Project presentations (Final exam slot, March 18th, 4-7pm)

Here, again, is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the teaching team plans to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade.

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement 
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish) 
    * judged by review of demonstration, user manual, peer review, teaching team testing 
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented 
    * judged by review of code/scope taking into account team background/experience etc.
* 20% Implementation 
    * judged by review of Github code, PRs, etc. 
    * use the README.md to make clear the repository structure and guide through implementation effort! 
* 15% Design Process 
    * judged by Design Document, Kanban Board, Meeting Logs, Github TEAM information, etc. Design Document should steer through the process.
* 10% Manual 


# UX Design
* [SW Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/HierarchyOfNeeds.pdf)
* [UX Metrics](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/UXMetrics.pdf)
* [8 Golden Rules of UI Design](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/Slides_UIPrinciples.pdf) 

* Tools for Wireframing: Figma, Wireframe.cc, miro.com, (Sketch on Mac, but no free option anymore(?),  Adobe XD in maintenance mode)...
  * Storybook and Vercel v0 can help

# Today: Work in Breakout Groups
* Standup
* Continue [lab06](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/lab/lab06/) 
    * Log Retrospective experiment outcome
    * Higher-level testing and documentation!
