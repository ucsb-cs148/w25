# Announcements

* Sorry, no crashers! Class enrollment is final (we are already overenrolled and will form groups immediately)

* [Teaching Team](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/staff/) Introduction 
* Please fill out the [Student Survey](https://ucsbltsc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0BdAlibkmzDO9dI) (required for enrolled students) 
* Please join our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/ucsb-cs148-w25/shared_invite/zt-2xh4a8io1-qjPBjt83coOfB7qGHOGUlQ)) (required for enrolled students)

# Team

* We have three TAs: Jamie (Chieh-Ying) Lai, Will (Zifeng) Zhang, Yunhao Luo 
* There are four Learning Assistants: Anderson Lee, Leo (Lixing) Guo, Rachel Jian, Samuel Zhu 
* We have three Lab Sections: Friday noon PDT, 1pm, and 2pm. People in the same group need to be in the same lab section. We may be able to swap some people based on group formation preferences and availability.  

We will have a mixture of office hours / open lab hours where the instructor, TA and LAs will be available.

We haven't had a chance to work out all the details yet.  Stay tuned.

# Preparation for Wednesday class

* Think about project ideas. On Wednesday, **we will already do group formation** around ideas.

Here is the procedure we will be following on group formation this week. The submission and voting requirements will count as points towards the first week Section.

1) Everyone, *by 2pm tomorrow, Tue, January 7 (for 20 Section points)*, please submit at least one project idea (a few sentences describing a mobile app that addresses a certain need) that you would be interested working on as a quarter group project. We will set up and send around on Slack and Canvas a Google Form for submitting these. Part of the submission is a comma-separated list of possible platforms / tech stacks that you might consider for implementing this idea. 

2) The teaching team will consolidate the submitted ideas into a list, and we will collect upvotes on the items before Wednesday's class. Voting deadline: *10:00am, Wed, January 8 (for 10 Section points)*. This anonymous vote will not directly affect group participation, it will just give us a sorting mechanism (popularity) for the ideas to group teams around in step 3. 

3) During class on Wednesday, we will gauge overall interest in certain platforms\/technology stacks, and will form project teams around the most popular ideas. Importantly, project topics are not set in stone at all, the ideas are just a vehicle to bring likeminded students together. Also, multiple groups can form around the same idea. The focus will change in any case over the quarter.

4) We will document the group formation in a Google Sheet and create Slack team channels for each successfully formed group.

5) Important constraints for the project team formation: 

    * A project group should consist of 6 or 7 students. 
    * Every student in the same project team needs to attend the same Section on Fridays (1pm, 2pm, 3pm). We will try to facilitate some swaps.  
    * Students need to have (or be able to get) access to the necessary equipment (host computer and possibly other devices) to work on the quarter project.

# Goals for class today

* You'll get a first idea of what this class is about
* On Slack, you can meet several of your classmates that you haven't met before
