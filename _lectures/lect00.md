# Announcements

* Sorry, no crashers! Class enrollment is final (we are already overenrolled and will form groups immediately)

* [Teaching Team](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/staff/) Introduction 
* Please fill out the [Student Survey](https://ucsbltsc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0BdAlibkmzDO9dI) (required for enrolled students) 
* Please join our [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/ucsb-cs148-w25/shared_invite/zt-2xh4a8io1-qjPBjt83coOfB7qGHOGUlQ)) (required for enrolled students)

# Team

* We have three TAs: Jamie (Chieh-Ying) Lai, Will (Zifeng) Zhang, Yunhao Luo 
* There are four Learning Assistants: Anderson Lee, Leo (Lixing) Guo, Rachel Jian, Samuel Zhu 
* We have three Lab Sections: Friday noon PDT, 1pm, and 2pm. People in the same group need to be in the same lab section. We may be able to swap some people based on group formation preferences and availability.  

We will have a mixture of office hours / open lab hours where the instructor, TA and LAs will be available.

We haven't had a chance to work out all the details yet.  Stay tuned.
