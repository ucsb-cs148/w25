# Coding with AI Recap

* ChatGPT well-liked general-purpose tool: Widely adopted for its flexibility in debugging, prototyping, and explaining unfamiliar code, making it the most-loved AI tool among students.
* Efficiency meets caution: While AI drastically reduced repetitive coding and accelerated learning, careful testing, manual review, and specific prompts remained essential to ensure correctness.
* Broad use cases for different tools: From generating UI designs and writing unit tests to researching frameworks and structuring large codebases, AI tools showed strong potential when combined with human oversight.
* Detailed report in Slack #help_ai

You are likely getting reminders from the automated system about course evaluations. Please enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the course quality via several ratings under "Your experience of the course and instruction". 

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Thank you all for taking the time!
