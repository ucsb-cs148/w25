# Announcements
* h06 is due **on Monday, February 12th**. Focus on your MVP over the next 8 days!  
* catme.org peer reviews are due Friday night with the rest of [lab03](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/lab/lab03/). Please use your ucsb.edu email to log on. You get 20 lab03 points for it, so please don't miss it! **Let us know if you didn't get an email (to your ucsb account!) on Monday during class**

# MVP Presentations
* MVP demonstrations will be video demos, peer-evaluated Section by Section during [lab05](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/lab/lab05/)
* MVP demos shopuld be **user-oriented**

# Final Presentations 

* Final presentations will be live demonstations in front of the whole class, and evaluated by the teaching team (plus an audience choice poll). 
* Final presentations should be **both user- and stakeholder-oriented**. 

* **4pm to 7pm, Thursday, March 18th** (original finals slot)

Here is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the teaching team plans to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade.

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement 
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish) 
    * judged by review of demonstration, user manual, peer review, teaching team testing 
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented 
    * judged by review of code/scope taking into account team background/experience etc.
* 20% Implementation 
    * judged by review of Github code, PRs, etc. 
    * use the README.md to make clear the repository structure and guide through implementation effort! 
* 15% Design Process 
    * judged by Design Document, Kanban Board, Meeting Logs, Github TEAM information, etc. Design Document should steer through the process.
* 10% Manual 

We will cross-reference against both an initial quartiling judgment averaged among the evaluators, and against a ranking stemming from peer-review
