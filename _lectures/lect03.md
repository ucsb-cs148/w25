# Electronic Handouts:

# Sprint Planning
Part of your [lab02](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/lab/lab02/) deliverables will include documentation of at least one Sprint Planning meeting in a team/sprint0?/ folder in your main repo (question mark for number of your current sprint, which may vary from team to team). For the purpose and mechanisms of a Sprint Planning meeting see, e.g., pages 25-27 of [our Scrum booklet](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/Scrum.pdf). It is OK for such a meeting to already have happened and to be documented retroactively.


# IMPORTANT Update on User Story Mapping

Github Projects has changed substantially since the last time this course was taught. Prof. Conrad's videos posted in the [lect02 notes](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/lectures/lect02/) still describe what we are trying to accomplish, but the mechanisms that GitHub Projects support have been revamped since then. The old [Github Projects (classic) experience is actually still available](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards), but [the new experience has several powerful new features](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects), so we will adapt and practice the new functionality in this course. 

We will give a brief demo on Kanban Board mapping in class today. 

The most important pieces of information are: 
* You can now have several Github Projects associated with any one Repository (but we will likely maintain a 1-1 mapping) 
* Instrad of the old system of Cards and Issues, now every new item is created as an Issue. 
* There is a new powerful system of custom fields and tags. We will use a custom field "ItemType" to distinguish between User Stories and Issues. 
* You have new helpful views of your User Stories and Issues in addition of the Kanban Board: Item View, Roadmap view, and custom tables.
