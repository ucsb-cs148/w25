# ESCIs (Course Evaluations)

You are likely getting reminders from the automated system about course evaluations. Please enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the course quality via several ratings under "Your experience of the course and instruction". 

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Thank you all for taking the time!
