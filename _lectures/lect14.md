# Announcements
* **Thank You** for participating in the inter-team eval exercise last Wednesday! You did receive a spreadsheet with feedback from the other team in your Slack channel on Friday. Please discuss and craft your (brief!) response/action items going forward.  

* [Lab08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/lab/lab08/) has deadlines coming up: 
    * team/EVAL_RESPONSE.md (see below)
    * team/Contribs.md started
    * User Manual document started
    * Third and last required retrospective 

* Full focus on finalizing your product! 
    * **Friday, 03/14** (Code Freeze, Final Code Release)


# FOLLOW-UP instructions for Reviewees (**points for lab08**), due on Friday, March 7th (with the rest of lab08)

In a file `team/evaluation/EVAL_RESPONSE.md`, please document the following:  

An overall **response** to the sections of the reviewers report, including actions that you may take as a team.
       You will find an aggregation of all user feedback on your team's slack channel. 
       As a reminder, the reviewing form sections that will be listed are repeated here: 
       
        1.  Feedback based on your own USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md
        2.  A summary of the features of the product as the other team understood them, and what they liked or thought could be
            improved about each
        3.  How effective it was to use the project in its current state (comments about the robustness of the app and the current UI/UX design)
        4.  A summary of how the other team was able to follow the deployment instructions and how helpful / organized the other team found your team's repo (README.md, Kanban Board, maybe code).
        5.  The other team's final closing thoughts: something they liked, the most impactful opportunity for improvement,
            and one more thing they thought was good.
<br><br>


Your response should at least have the following content: 
       
        1.  Decisions your team is making regarding the feedback on your USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md
        2.  Additional decisions your team is making based on feedback you received. Please reference what reviewing form section (numbers 2-5 above)   the feedback you are reacting to came from (this is important to the teaching team!) and state your plans regarding that feedback. 
        (Not all plans need to be able to be implemented - it is ok to talk about stretch goals. The important part is the team discussion regarding the best possible end product.)


# ESCIs (Course Evaluations)

The [W25 Instructor Survey](https://go.blueja.io/PqwV_o3TlkyuvzxpPp_91w) course evaluation will be due on **Friday, March 14, 23:59**

You are likely getting reminders from the automated system about course evaluations. Please enter your feedback about the course.  It is very important for the university to evaluate the course quality via several ratings under "Your experience of the course and instruction". 

A project-oriented course such as CS148 emphasizes learning by doing and the experience of working in teams over lectures and traditional exams and homeworks. If you see value in that approach, please do consider mentioning it as there are always debates on the future structure of the curriculum.  

Thank you all for taking the time!
