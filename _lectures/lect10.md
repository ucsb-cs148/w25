# Announcements
* Reminder: H08 due Monday EOD (no class due to Presidents' Day holiday)
* We still focus on the momentum from your MVPs and move towards CI/CD!
* Finish up [lab05](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w25/lab/lab05/) requirements: 1) MVP **review response** in `team/MVP_FOLLOWUP.md` 2) **Unit Testing** experiments, documented in `team/TESTING.md`, 3) **Individual** AI coding experiments, documented in `team/AI_CODING.md`

* [lab06](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/lab/lab06/) will require you to go beyond unit testing:
* Implement at least one higher-level (Integration, Component, or BDD) test with a testing library of your choice over the next week!
* Another RETRO meeting is also part of lab06. Plan for it now and do it either this Friday, or schedule outside of class!
* Second Peer Evaluation at CATME.org coming up next week, also as Lab06 credit!  



# More Info on Testing
* Slides for high-level overview and motivation: [Testing for the Skeptical Developer](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/Slides_2021-testingfortheskepticaldeveloper.pdf)

* Sometimes, component testing is done as black-box testing by a testing team, separate from the developer team: [Difference between component and unit testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-component-and-unit-testing/)

* Testing Coverage: **code coverage** vs. **test coverage**
* [Code vs. execution/test coverage: a kid's toy example by the Lead of SW Testing at eBay](https://danashby.co.uk/2019/02/14/code-coverage-vs-test-coverage/)
* [Code vs. test coverage](https://www.testbytes.net/blog/code-coverage-vs-test-coverage/)

* Possible Testing Libraries: 
    * [Jest](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/topics/testing_jest/)
    * [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/getting-started)
    * [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io)
    * [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) (and [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) and [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org))

    * [Component Testing with Cypress](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/jstopics/testing_cypress/)
    * [Component Testing with Storybook](https://storybook.js.org), also [works with ReactNative](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react-native/en/get-started/)

    * [End-to-end Modern Web App Testing with Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

* Remember the overview articles: 
    * [Overview of Javascript Testing](https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-7ce7298b9870), [PDF version](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/CS148/handouts/JSTesting.pdf) 
    * [Python Testing Frameworks](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/10/27/top-python-testing-frameworks/)

# Today: Work in Breakout Groups
* Standup
* Work on new features and on unit testing requirement, AI Coding, and review responses for [lab05](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/lab/lab05/). Discuss best testing frameworks/strategies based on what your team members found out. Plan Retrospective!
