# Announcements
* H08 due next Wednesday (next Monday is Presidents' Day holiday)
* We still focus on the momentum from your MVPs and move towards CI/CD!
* Finish up [lab05](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/lab/lab05/) requirements: 1) MVP **review response** in `team/MVP_FOLLOWUP.md` 2) **Unit Testing** experiments, documented in `team/TESTING.md`, 3) **Individual** AI coding experiments, documented in `team/AI_CODING.md`

* [lab06](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/lab/lab06/) will require you to go beyond unit testing:
* Implement at least one higher-level (Integration, Component, or BDD) test with a testing library of your choice over the next week!
* Another RETRO meeting is also part of lab06. Plan for it now and do it either this Friday, or schedule outside of class!
* Second Peer Evaluation at CATME.org coming up next week, also as Lab06 credit!

# Today: Work in Breakout Groups
* Standup
* Work on new features and on unit testing requirement, AI COding, and review responses for [lab05](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/w24/lab/lab05/). Discuss best testing frameworks/strategies based on what your team members found out. Plan Retrospective!
